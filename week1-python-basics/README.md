## Week 1 – Human Before Hacker

I don't want to just "learn to code" like everyone else.

I want to build **self-worth**, **discipline**, and **direction** — in public, using code as my medium.  
Every file here is part of a conversation with myself and those like me who need a signal to rise.

- `day1_broken_loop_of_life.py`: A loop that reflects energy, distraction, and consistency in life.
- `day2_inner_agent.py`: A command-line interaction that reflects your mood and pushes you to stay committed. It's the earliest form of AI-like thinking — emotional logic.
- `day3_decision_tree.py`: A reflective decision tree that helps navigate between Nursing, Computer Science, or uncertainty — using nested conditionals to simulate life paths.
- `day4_foundation_block.py`: A reflection of confusing effort and logic-driven clarity. This script teaches you to separate thoughts, actions, and outcomes — the base of any real builder’s mindset.
- `day5_script_that_wrote_you.py`: A reflection on the auto-pilot life we've been handed. Uses functions, lists, and conditionals to simulate a life script — and inspire authorship.
- `day6_eternal_pillar.py`: A pure example of coding fundamentals — variables, conditionals, loops, and functions — all tied together with clarity and self-reflection.
- `day7_life_architect.py`: A script to design your day like a software architect — install traits, avoid triggers, and boot your identity with intention. Combines lists, loops, choices, and reflection.
- `day8_last_spark.py`: A code for days with no motivation. You just write one line. If there’s a hint of hope in it — we honor it. If not, we still count the effort.
- `day9_reboot_button.py`: A quick mental reset tool. Asks if you're ready to reboot emotionally — and reminds you it's always okay to restart.
- `day10_time_mirror.py`: Inspired by the 38% hidden time concept. Helps you calculate how much free time you really have and whether you’re using it for deep work or distractions.
- `day11_prime_checker.py`: Optimized prime number checker using the 6k ± 1 rule. Shows grasp of number theory, performance, and control flow — a staple in CS interviews.
